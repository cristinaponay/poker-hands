# Poker Hands
This a JavaScript assignment in which I used the Decks of Cards API https://deckofcardsapi.com to demonstrate the use of AJAX data retrieval.

It will retrieve a deck of cards first and use the deck_id to draw 5 cards from the deck then it shall display the highest poker hand from the drawn cards.

To see it in action, go to: https://cristinaponay.com/poker-hands
